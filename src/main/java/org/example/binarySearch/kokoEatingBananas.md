Why not sort first the piles array?

Excellent question! 🙌
You might expect sorting to help, but in this problem — you don’t need to sort piles at all. Here's why:

🎯 Goal Recap:
We’re trying to find the minimum eating speed k such that Koko finishes all bananas in h hours.

For a given speed k, the total hours she needs is:
java
Copy
Edit
hours += (pile + k - 1) / k;
This is just a simulation of how long each pile takes at speed k. The order of the piles doesn’t affect the total time.

🤔 So Why Not Sort?
Sorting adds O(n log n) time.

It doesn’t change the result of our canFinish() function.

It’s unnecessary and adds overhead.

💡 When Would Sorting Help?
Sorting helps if the algorithm’s logic depends on order, for example:

Greedy strategies

Sliding window

When choosing smallest or largest elements

But here, we’re just summing the time per pile, so the order doesn’t matter at all.

ujung2nya tetep iterasi semua piles untuk counts hours nya

That is a fantastic and very insightful question! 👏

You're absolutely right to wonder:

**"If we're jumping by half each time in binary search, how do we know we're not skipping over the correct answer?"**

Let’s break it down in a clear, intuitive way. 🍌

🧠 What Makes Binary Search Safe Here?
The key reason binary search works perfectly in this problem is because of the monotonic property of the search space.

🔑 What’s a Monotonic Function?
We’re checking:

java
Copy
Edit
canFinish(piles, h, k)
This function returns:

false when k is too small (can't finish in time)

true when k is big enough (can finish in h hours)

So the return values go from false → true, and never flip back.

💡 That’s a monotonic increasing pattern:

csharp
Copy
Edit
false false false false true true true
↑
the answer is here
Binary search is perfect for this kind of pattern. It helps us zoom in without missing the smallest k that returns true.

💬 Think of It This Way:
Imagine we're looking for the smallest k such that the condition is true.

If we try a k = mid:

If canFinish(k) is false → k is too small, so we go right

If canFinish(k) is true → this might be the answer, but maybe there's a smaller valid k, so we go left and keep checking

We always narrow in on the smallest valid k.

🧪 Example:
Let’s say max(piles) = 11, and we try:

ini
Copy
Edit
left = 1, right = 11
mid = 6 → canFinish(6)? → false → too slow → go right
left = 7, right = 11
mid = 9 → canFinish(9)? → true → might be too fast → go left
left = 7, right = 9
mid = 8 → canFinish(8)? → true → go left again
left = 7, right = 8
mid = 7 → canFinish(7)? → true → go left again
left = 7, right = 7 → done!
We never miss the correct answer, even though we keep "jumping."

📌 Why Not Just Linearly Check?
You could loop from 1 to max(piles), but that’s O(n × max(pile)) — way slower.
Binary search cuts that to O(n × log(max(pile))), which is much faster for large inputs.

✅ TL;DR
You won't skip or miss the correct value because:

The function you're searching is monotonic (true stays true after it starts)

You’re always checking mid and narrowing the range

Binary search guarantees finding the minimum valid k
